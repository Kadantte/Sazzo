<h3><b>Hello there! I'm Sazz! ðŸ˜Š</b></h3>

I'm a backend developer living in Salvador, Brazil! I mostly use the nickname of "sazz" but my real name is Felipe and I'm 14 years old. 

---

I love to create things which I think will be useful for someone or it's a super crazy idea, I also don't like so much the idea of learning multiple programming languages in the same time, I prefer focus on one and just learn what I need and make use. My relevant projects are pinned, but here is a brief description about what i'm doing now:

- âœ¨ Ritsu, A Discord Bot based on the AnimeMusicQuiz (AMQ) game, is one of my biggest projects and now is on more than 900 guilds and serving around 100 matches everyday.
- ðŸ“š Koyumi, A open-source platform where you can find in which chapter of the manga your favorite anime ended up! One of my crazy ideas and still not finished, this project is a mix of what I think will be useful for me and for other people and with me learning more about NestJS and VueJS.
- ðŸŽ² AleScore, A website that shows Alexandre Esteves last changed score on MyAnimeList. This is a really funny one, I made this for one of my favorite brazilian anime youtubers, Jumentossauro which is something that's started as meme ("Looks like people are watching my animelist to see I change a score") to a real website.

## ðŸ’Œ How to reach me 

- The most easy what to get in touch with me, is sending me a direct message on Discord: `sazz#1000`
- If you want do send me in a more professional way, you can send me a email using this address [sazz@ritsu.fun](mailto:sazz@ritsu.fun)
- Otherwise, feel free to send me a DM on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FelipeSazz) which usually I post some brazilian shit and talk about my tedious life.
- I also have a [Telegram](https://t.me/FelipeSazz), but I don't use so much so the chance you will get ignored is high.
