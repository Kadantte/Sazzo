<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hello there.</h3>

I'm a  software engineer and backend developer.
<br>
Coding since 8 years old, doing minecraft plugins and a lot of things. Passionate about anime and manga, that's why my projects have so much weeb energy on them.

Professional in abandoning projects, and loves to mess around with different technologies. Proficient in **TS/JS**, especially on server-side and big fan of [Docker](https://docker.com) and [Prisma](https://prisma.io).

Outside of programming, I love managing and moderating communities and reading some wholesome manga. Also, pineapple *shouldn't* be on pizza, this is a war crime.
