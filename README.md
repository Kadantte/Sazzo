👋 Hello! Welcome to my profile! Definitely one thing you need to know about me, I very rarely manage to complete projects, however, in my many attempts and other personal things that I do in my day to day life, I am always learning and looking for new challenges (more than maybe I can't complete them).

> **Actively working on https://github.com/RitsuProject**
