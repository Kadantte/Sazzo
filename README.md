<h3>👋 Hello there.</h3>

I'm a  software engineer, most focused on backend development with TypeScript! ❤
<br>
Coding since 8 years old, doing minecraft plugins and a lot of things. Passionate about anime and manga, that's why my projects have so much weeb energy on them.

Currently, I'm a backend developer at [CatManga](https://catmanga.org) where I have a chance to do amazing stuff with a lot of amazing people, in my free time, I like to work on personal projects too.

And...I'm a huge fan of [Prisma](https://prisma.io) and [Docker](https://docker.com)!
