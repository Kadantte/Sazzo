<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hello there.</h3>
I'm a software developer and freelancer based on Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
<br>
<br>

I work (usually) with **TypeScript**, **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, **Prisma**, **Svelte** and **React** + have more than six years of practical software development experience. Most of the time I'm working with clients (so...private repos!), but sometimes a miracle hits and I launch a personal project, which tends to be open-source.
